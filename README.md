##  Hi~! I'm still a student who's aspiring to become a Software Engineer ~~~

Messing around with GitHub and trying to know its ins and outs.

Will definitely be spamming a lot of stuffs in my profile.

I'm still a student, so if you have any helpful advice that you can give, I would happily take it.

##  Concepts that I need to study more:

:scroll:  Loops

:scroll:  JavaScript Rest Operator and Spread Operator

:scroll:  Destructuring in JavaScript

:scroll:  Learn about Design Patterns
